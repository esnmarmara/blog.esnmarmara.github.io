> “Welcome to my erasmus experiences.”


My Erasmus semester in Istanbul was one of the best experiences I’ve ever made in my life. Having that carefree life in Kadiköy, enjoying the countless opportunities to do, to eat and drink, to spend time and just have fun until dawn are aspects building the basis of that experience. But needless to say, these experiences are only possible to make if you have friends with whom you can share your moments. And I’m glad that I have found some really good friends during the Erasmus semester. In this regard, it’s important to mention that ESN Marmara did a great job to make it possible that people could get to know each other easily and in enjoyable atmospheres. The organized events, trips, and parties were a lot of fun and well mentored by the buddies. I regret nothing and would recommend everybody to come to Istanbul because it’s one of the most stunning cities in the world.
